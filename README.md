This will be helpful of the individual who are trying to gain industry experience.You can take a look at the Industry level coding for 3 Tier architectural patterns.

Existing system : 
Currently ATM  transaction is only one way i.e one user can do a transaction on a ATM with only one bank account. There is no provision for the user to remember or change his/her password using the same card

Proposed System : 
ATM transaction has been simplified by using the same card for different bank accounts. User has a priviledge to change his ATM pin and can carry out his transaction on different banks as a normal process.
